# ME-Data

ME-Data is a **data processing pipeline** designed to transform diverse client-provided inputs (PDFs, Word, Markdown, spreadsheets, etc.) into **standardized formats** ready for model editing frameworks (e.g., WISE, GRACE, or improved variants).

It enables enterprises to **seamlessly integrate heterogeneous data into model workflows** without requiring engineering expertise.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

* **Multi-format Support**: Automatically parses and cleans PDFs, Word, Markdown, and Excel files.
* **Unified Data Format**: Outputs standardized JSON structures compatible with model editing frameworks.
* **Plug-and-Play Integration**: Works out-of-the-box with editing methods and base models such as LLaMA, Qwen, and others.
* **Enterprise-Ready**: Designed for financial, legal, and enterprise scenarios where reliability and compliance matter.

---

## ðŸš€ Use Cases

* **Financial Institutions**: Convert reports, contracts, and compliance docs into model-editable knowledge.
* **Knowledge Management**: Standardize scattered documents into a unified knowledge base for large-scale NLP tasks.
* **Product Applications**: Provide clients with an end-to-end pipeline to upload raw data and get model-ready inputs instantly.
